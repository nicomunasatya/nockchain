# Nockchain
running nockchain using CLI miner with VPS

## Nockchain
Nockchain is a lightweight chain for heavyweight compute. It uses ZK-Proof of Work (zkPoW). Miners create a ZK-Proof (ZKP) of a fixed puzzle computation, then hash the ZKP, and earn $NOCK based on their computation power.

The team has released a Public Testnet to run a ***local testnet node*** and a ***testnet miner***, to explore how Nockchain works before Mainnet goes live.

## $NOCK Details
- Genesis Mainnet and NOCK Mining starts May 21th.
- 10-min block times (like Bitcoin).
- Total Supply: 2^32 nocks (around 4.29 billion).
- Fair launch: 100% of $NOCK will be issued to Miners.
- $NOCK is used to pay for blockspace on Nockchain.

## How to Mine
* The mining terms is exactly same a Bitcoin PoW mining.
* More computational power = More rewards
* More miners on the network = Higher hashrate = More difficulty to mine rewards

### Method 1: Solo (CLI):
* You run a solo CPU-based Miner Node on your system which will certainly need a powerful hardware.
* You can follow [CLI Setup](https://github.com/0xmoei/nockchain/blob/main/README.md#cli-miner-setup) steps.

### Method 2: Pool & Method 3: GUI
* You join a pool (same as bitcoin mining), share your computational power and earn rewards in a shared pool of rewards.
* Official mining method is CLI introduced by the team, and no official Pool or GUI mining programs introduced.
* But new community-driven *Projects* and *Pools* are poping up.
* **GUI Setup (App)**: There's a new project called [**Nockpool**](https://swps.io/nockpool), I think they are building a GUI-based Node so you can easily open a wallet on Windows, join a pool, and Mine $NOCK.

# CLI Miner Setup
## Hardware Requirements
Hardware requirement is highly speculative since no one knows how Mainnet-launch goes.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="3">Miner is CPU-based initially</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>RAM</td>
    <td>CPU</td>
    <td>Disk</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>64 GB</code></td>
    <td><code>6 cores or higher</code></td>
    <td><code>100-200 GB SSD</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

* more CPU = more hashrate = more chances
* We still can't say that's enough, because it's just a testnet environment and we need to wait until mainnet.

## OS Requirements

* **Windows Users:** Install Linux Ubuntu on your Windows using this [Guide](https://github.com/0xmoei/Install-Linux-on-Windows)
* **VPS:** Recommended crypto-payment VPS provider to [Purchase](https://my.hostbrr.com/order/forms/a/NTMxNw==) or Visit [VPS Beginner Guide](https://github.com/0xmoei/Linux_Node_Guide/)

> Note: Miners are initially CPU-based for users and will eventually move to GPU and ASIC later
